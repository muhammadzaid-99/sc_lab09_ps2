/**
 * A graph-based poetry generator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * GraphPoet is initialized with a corpus of text, which it uses to derive a
 * word affinity graph. Vertices in the graph are words. Words are defined as
 * non-empty case-insensitive strings of non-space non-newline characters. They
 * are delimited in the corpus by spaces, newlines, or the ends of the file.
 * Edges in the graph count adjacencies: the number of times "w1" is followed by
 * "w2" in the corpus is the weight of the edge from w1 to w2.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, given this corpus:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     Hello, HELLO, hello, goodbye!
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * the graph would contain two edges:
 * <ul>
 * <li>("hello,") -> ("hello,") with weight 2
 * <li>("hello,") -> ("goodbye!") with weight 1
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * where the vertices represent case-insensitive {@code "hello,"} and
 * {@code "goodbye!"}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Given an input string, GraphPoet generates a poem by attempting to insert a
 * bridge word between every adjacent pair of words in the input. The bridge
 * word between input words "w1" and "w2" will be some "b" such that w1 -> b ->
 * w2 is a two-edge-long path with maximum-weight weight among all the
 * two-edge-long paths from w1 to w2 in the affinity graph. If there are no such
 * paths, no bridge word is inserted. In the output poem, input words retain
 * their original case, while bridge words are lower case. The whitespace
 * between every word in the poem is a single space.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, given this corpus:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     This is a test of the Mugar Omni Theater sound system.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * on this input:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     Test the system.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * the output poem would be:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     Test of the system.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * PS2 instructions: this is a required ADT class, and you MUST NOT weaken the
 * required specifications. However, you MAY strengthen the specifications and
 * you MAY add additional methods. You MUST use Graph in your rep, but otherwise
 * the implementation of this class is up to you.
